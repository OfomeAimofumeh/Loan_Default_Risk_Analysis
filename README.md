## Executive Summary

This dataset records 1,000 Lending Club loans with an overall default rate is of 40.1% and fully paid rate of 60%. This is considered high as we are looking for the lowest default rate to avoid defaulters, the majority of loss is concentrated in the high risk segment confirming the need for stricter restrictions at the point of decision. The top drivers of loan default include:
### 1. *Credit Score*

- Borrowers with a credit score under the poor and very poor categories account for 70.0% and 76.6% respectively highlighting that individuals with a poor credit score are more likely to default

### 2. *Interest Rate*

- Borrowers with Very High (63.9%) interest rates carry a higher risk of defaulting compared to those with low interest rates attached to their loans

### 3. *Income Level*

- Borrowers with Low income levels have a 76.8% default rate on loan defaults compared to those with a high income level who only account for 33.0% of the Overall default rate.
A connecting factor is all individuals with low income havde poor/ bad credit and their loans come with a high income level which makes these factors interrelated

## Recommedations
### 1. *TIGHTEN APPROVAL RULES FOR HIGH RISK CREDIT SEGMENTS* 
As the Poor and Very Poor credit individuals have the highest default rates, loan approval should be either subject to extra income verification, capped at lower limits or rejected outright unless risk mitigation documents are provided as they are the group responsible for the highest level of loss on this dashboard. 
### 2. *ADJUSTMENT OF INTEREST RATE* 
Default increases drastically when the interest rate is higher, instead of raising interest rate as a risk penalty the lender should offer a limited loan amount to the borrower, offer shorter terms or require a co-signer to reduce the push into delinquency. 
### 3. *STRENGTHEN VERIFICATION FOR LOW INCOME BORROWERS* 
Low income applicants are defaulting at double the rate of others, to prevent this actions like requiring stronger prove of income should be requested, checking of employment stability, lowering the maximum loan amount or offering lower interest short term loans only should be adapted to reduce stress on borrowers who are less likely to repay a large loan amount. 
### 4. *APPLY PURPOSE BASED UNDERWRITING* 
Riskier loan purposes like Small business and Medical reasons should have higher documentation requirements, they should also mandate expense or credit checks and have a lower approval rate. While lower risk purposes can have streamlined approvals. 
### 5. *ADD ONGOING LOAN RISK MONITORING* 
Borrowers in risk sensitive categories should be flagged early with a late payment alert, multiple recent loan utilization, early intervention can reduce default before it becomes irreversible
